    "Electricity has become an essential need to any institution in modern society, especially when our technology is heavily dependent on it. Almost everything we work with everyday requires some kind of electricity. However, power outages in the electricity network are not uncommon in people’s lives. In recent years, power outages have increased markedly, exceeding 8 hours of blackouts in 2020 and 7 hours in 2021 [1]. As defined by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the major outages refer to those that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load loss of at least 300 MW. \n",
    "\n",
    "There may be various reasons that can cause power outages, such as severe weather, equipment failure, or system operability disruption, overloaded power grids, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a study shows, power outages can be attributed to a combination of various factors, including natural hazards (and its type), scale of overhead transmission and distribution (T&D) systems, the extent of state-level rural v.s. urban areas, and levels of investments in the infrastructure, etc. The type of natural disaster implies how it may impact the robustness of the power system.  There can be underground power systems, but if they are overhead, the more exposed they are, the easier they are to malfunction, which means the higher the grid's vulnerability to failures. Similarly, the researchers suggest, outages are more common in states with lower urban population and higher rural population, where the areas people live in receive less attention and investment in maintaining the power systems, making them more vulnerable to natural hazards, system operability disruption, attacks, etc. and affect millions of people [2]. To narrow down the focus of our project, we specifically explore the extent of impact of system operability disruption on power systems and to see whether there is a large enough impact that the government should take actions. Our primary concern is the well-being of individuals affected by outages, and we measure the effect by analyzing the number of affected customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study conducts an analysis of power system resilience in the U.S., suggesting that economic factors, such as real GDP per capita and the expected utility’s construction to total state product (GSP), plays a significant role for recovery time and efficiency of recovery [3]. A better economic condition contributes to faster resolution of blackouts, as well as increased likelihood of regular maintenance and operational activities. This, in turn, will lead to a rise in GSP and a reduction in equipment or software program failures and amount of affected customers. Therefore, by analyzing the influence of system operability disruption on customers, we will also be able to analyze how government and utility companies are expected to take care of power systems, either daily and during the recovery process.\n",

    "The ethics evaluation in our data analysis project can be divided into three main aspects: Minimizing bias, Respecting privacy, and Minimizing undue harm now and in the future. Our project has nine components, including Questioning, Implication, Dataset, Informed Consent, Privacy, Evaluation, Analysis, Transparency, and Continuous Monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our project has a limited timeframe, we have chosen to use existing publicly available datasets rather than collecting data ourselves. As a result, our Ethics and Privacy Concerns can be categorized into two main types. The first type involves the analysis of the data itself and its sources, while the second type relates to the impact of our group members' data analysis methods and influence on society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is sourced from Purdue University's \"Major Power Outage Risks in The U.S.\" According to the paper titled \"Data On Major Power Outage Events in the continental U.S.\" from 2018, the data from these sources were aggregated based on the year, month, and region (U.S. state). The major power outages were characterized by their duration and the total number of affected customers during each event. Rigorous preprocessing techniques were employed to minimize measurement errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The description of the data sources mentioned above satisfies our three main ethical concerns. Regarding bias, the data is collected in a fair and equal manner, capturing power outage incidents across the entire United States. There is no omission of specific regions that could lead to an unfair consideration of the power outage situations for all individuals; regarding privacy, the dataset does not contain any specific individual information. It only provides information on power outages in specific regions at certain times. The data parameters do not allow us to access sensitive information about specific individuals or locations; regarding minimizing undue harm now and in the future, the data collection process is conducted through the government. The adverse effects of power outages on individuals and communities are not further stimulated or aggravated due to the data collection process. Considering the above, the data collection process and dataset itself  adheres to our ethical standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, Our data processing involves three main processes: Questioning, Evaluation, and Analysis.   In our questioning process, we aim to explore the correlation between power outages and population density nationwide. The design of this question includes every state within our investigation, ensuring fairness and inclusivity. Investigating this correlation aims to facilitate better preparedness and mitigation strategies to reduce the frequency of power outages, which aligns with the goal of minimizing harm now and in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the evaluation and analysis processes, we may encounter data ethics issues. One such issue is the need for a consistent metric to evaluate the relationship between power outages and population density. Other parameters, including factors such as time, temperature, and more, should not influence this metric. It is essential to carefully consider the selection and application of the metric to ensure fairness, objectivity, and unbiased analysis. Suppose our metric for evaluating the relationship between power outages and population density is influenced by time. In that case, it can have consequences where we obtain correlation results without being able to conduct further analysis. This is because the observed correlation may not be causally linked to the geographic regions or population density. Engaging in incorrect analysis based on this correlation can lead to inaccurate conclusions, mislead our readers, and raise ethical concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting this approach, we can provide a more rigorous demonstration of our hypothesis and avoid drawing unethical conclusions from the data. This method ensures that our analysis is conducted in a thorough and unbiased manner, minimizing the risk of ethical concerns related to the data.\n",
